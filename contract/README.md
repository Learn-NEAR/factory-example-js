# Factory Contract

A factory is a smart contract that stores a compiled contract on itself, and automatizes deploying it into
sub-accounts.

This particular example presents a factory of [donation contracts](https://github.com/near-examples/donation-rust),
and enables to:

1. Create a sub-account of the factory and deploy the stored contract on it (`create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy`).
2. Change the stored contract using the `update_stored_contract` method.

```typescript
@call({ payableFunction: true })
create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy({
  name,
  beneficiary,
  public_key,
}: {
  name: string;
  beneficiary: AccountId;
  public_key?: string;
}): NearPromise {
  // Assert the sub-account is valid
  const currentAccount = near.currentAccountId();
  const subaccount = `${name}.${currentAccount}`;

  assert(validateAccountId(subaccount), "Invalid subaccount");

  // Assert enough money is attached to create the account and deploy the contract
  const attached = near.attachedDeposit();

  const contractBytes = this.code.length;
  const minimumNeeded = NEAR_PER_STORAGE * BigInt(contractBytes);

  assert(attached >= minimumNeeded, `Attach at least ${minimumNeeded} yâ“ƒ`);

  const initArgs: DonationInitArgs = { beneficiary };

  const promise = NearPromise.new(subaccount)
    .createAccount()
    .transfer(attached)
    .deployContract(this.code)
    .functionCall("init", serialize(initArgs), NO_DEPOSIT, TGAS * 5n);

  // Add full access key is the user passes one
  if (public_key) {
    promise.addFullAccessKey(new PublicKey(public_key));
  }

  // Add callback
  const callbackArgs: Parameters<
    typeof this.create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy_callback
  >[0] = {
    account: subaccount,
    user: near.predecessorAccountId(),
    attached,
  };

  return promise.then(
    NearPromise.new(currentAccount).functionCall(
      "create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy_callback",
      serialize(callbackArgs),
      NO_DEPOSIT,
      TGAS * 5n
    )
  );
}

@call({ privateFunction: true })
update_stored_contract(): void {
  // This method receives the code to be stored in the contract directly
  // from the contract's input. In this way, it avoids the overhead of
  // deserializing parameters, which would consume a huge amount of GAS
  const input = near.input();

  assert(input, "Error: No input");

  this.code = input;
}
```

# Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the [`NEAR CLI`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<br />

## 1. Build and Deploy the Contract

You can automatically compile and deploy the contract in the NEAR testnet by running:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Once finished, check the `neardev/dev-account` file to find the address in which the contract was deployed:

```bash
cat ./neardev/dev-account
# e.g. dev-1659899566943-21539992274727
```

<br />

## 2. Deploy the Stored Contract Into a Sub-Account

`create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy` will create a sub-account of the factory and deploy the
stored contract on it.

```bash
near call <factory-account> create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy '{ "name": "sub", "beneficiary": "<account-to-be-beneficiary>"}' --deposit 1.24 --accountId <account-id> --gas 300000000000000
```

This will create the `sub.<factory-account>`, which will have a `donation` contract deployed on it:

```bash
near view sub.<factory-account> get_beneficiary
# expected response is: <account-to-be-beneficiary>
```

<br />

## 3. Update the Stored Contract

`update_stored_contract` enables to change the compiled contract that the factory stores.

The method is interesting because it has no declared parameters, and yet it takes
an input: the new contract to store as a stream of bytes.

To use it, we need to transform the contract we want to store into its `base64`
representation, and pass the result as input to the method:

```bash
# Use near-cli to update stored contract
export BYTES=`cat ./src/to/new-contract/contract.wasm | base64`
near call <factory-account> update_stored_contract "$BYTES" --base64 --accountId <factory-account> --gas 30000000000000
```

> This works because the arguments of a call can be either a `JSON` object or a `String Buffer`

## Factories - Explanations & Limitations

Factories are an interesting concept, here we further explain some of their implementation aspects,
as well as their limitations.

<br>

### Automatically Creating Accounts

NEAR accounts can only create sub-accounts of itself, therefore, the `factory` can only create and
deploy contracts on its own sub-accounts.

This means that the factory:

1. **Can** create `sub.factory.testnet` and deploy a contract on it.
2. **Cannot** create sub-accounts of the `predecessor`.
3. **Can** create new accounts (e.g. `account.testnet`), but **cannot** deploy contracts on them.

It is important to remember that, while `factory.testnet` can create `sub.factory.testnet`, it has
no control over it after its creation.

<br>

### The Update Method

The `update_stored_contracts` has a very short implementation:

```typescript
@call({ privateFunction: true })
update_stored_contract(): void {
  // This method receives the code to be stored in the contract directly
  // from the contract's input. In this way, it avoids the overhead of
  // deserializing parameters, which would consume a huge amount of GAS
  const input = near.input();

  assert(input, "Error: No input");

  this.code = input;
}
```

On first sight it looks like the method takes no input parameters, but we can see that its only
line of code reads from `near.input()`. What is happening here is that `update_stored_contract`
**bypasses** the step of **deserializing the input**.

You could implement `update_stored_contract({ new_code }: { new_code: string })`,
which takes the compiled code to store as a `string`, but that would trigger the contract to:

1. Deserialize the `new_code` variable from the input.
2. Sanitize it, making sure it is correctly built.

When dealing with big streams of input data (as is the compiled `wasm` file to be stored), this process
of deserializing/checking the input ends up **consuming the whole GAS** for the transaction.
